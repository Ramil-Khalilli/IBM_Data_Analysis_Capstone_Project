# IBM Data Analysis Capstone Project

## Project Overview  
This project is the capstone of the IBM Data Analyst course on Coursera. It demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Python and its libraries. 
The project was conducted in Jupyter Notebook and involved data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**.

## Key Objectives  
- Clean raw data and handle missing values.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Visualize insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Derive meaningful business insights from the dataset.

## Dataset used
- Survey data on programming languages in use.

## Tools & Technologies  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries Used:  
  - Pandas – Data Cleaning & Manipulation  
  - Matplotlib – Data Visualization  
  - Seaborn – Statistical Visualizations  

## Data Processing Steps and Repository Structure
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding distributions, correlations, and patterns.  
3. Data Visualization: Creating plots to support insights and findings.

## Results
1. The most used programming languages according to the survey are HTML/CSS, Javascript, Typescript.
2. The most desired programming language to learn is Python
3. There is a strong correlation between employee's age and their job satisfaction level. Till age 40s and 50s, as age increases, the job satisfaction level also increases but after
   that age, they are inversely proportional.
